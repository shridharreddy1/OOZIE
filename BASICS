  OOZIE
-------------------------------------
Oozie is one of the component of hadoop which is built on top of HDFS & is exclusively meant for the workflow creation & scheduling of
some workflow creation & scheduling of some workflows.

Process name of oozie is known as bootstrap.
needs start-all.sh & historyserver daemon

Oozie is open source ,distributed ,scalable & fault tolerant component which is s java based GUI tool in hadoop which always runs in the 
below hostname :
http:<<hostname of oozie>>:11000/oozie
http://localhost:11000/oozie

COMPONENT USED FOR TRIGGERING :
------------------------------
CronTab, Control-M,TWS,Autosys,$u,Quarz

The above component are used to work exclusively with hadoop 
-> only hadoop related jobs
-> follows DAG algorithms
-> niether for storage nor for processing

WHY DAG IS FOLLOWED IN OOZIE?
-------------------------------------
Until & unless the dependent task is not completed teh next task will not be started and if any failure in any tasks we need not to start 
the whole work from the scratch instead we can only resume the workflow from the failed task after recovery in a acyclic fashion. 


CORE-BUILDING BLOCKS OF OOZIES
-------------------------------

In order to create the workflow & schedule the workflow below are the building blocks
1. job.proper
ties 
2. workflow.xml
3. co-ordinator.xml

--> job.properties: The file consist of high level configuration details like :
                  a> where namenode physically running in the cluster 
                  b> where resource manager is running in the cluster
                  c> Queue name which is default by default  
                  d> workflow location/path in HDFS.
                  
--> workflow.xml: It is the collection of the <action> tag, where each & every action denotes 1 unit of task
--> coordinator.xml: It only talks about  how to schedule the workflow with some time frequency.Below are some of the parametre 
                     of coordinator.xml:
                     a> uniquejobid(which is autocreated by oozie)
                     b> jobname
                     c> starttime of the job
                     d> endtime of the job
                     e> status/job status   [ running,killed, suspended ,succeeded,etc ]
                     f> frequency of job    [ hourly, weekly,monthly ]
                     g> NextMaterialization

TRANSIENT PARAMETER IN OOZIE
-----------------------------------------

In the wokflow 
[OK TO] , [FAIL TO] 
These two tags are known as transit parameter which will talk about how transition need to take place from one action to another action.
